  <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>I pride myself on my eye for fashion, and ability to dress and accessorize my clients, in the perfect outfit for any occasion.  When I am not traveling to fashion shows in Los Angeles or New York and maintaining my fashonista persona, I love spending time with my girlfriends.  What better way to let loose and relax with your best friend? Shopping and Champagne!  This is how Besties Boutique was born.  I wanted to provide my clients with a comfortable, yet accommodating environment, where women are able to browse and try on anything that catches their eye, without the pressure to buy something. I'm not here to sell you lies. My ultimate goal is to help women feel amazing and confident, no matter what size, shape, or age.  My clients become my friends and I provide a place they love to come and shop with their Besties.</p>
